Consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a structural economic model.
%TODO Is this a good framing?
For $k \in \{1,\dots,K\}$, let

\begin{equation}
    Y_k = f_{\Theta}(X_k, Z_k; ),
\end{equation}

where $Y_k$ is a vector of outcome variables influenced by a vector of noise variables $Z_k$ via a set of (possibly endogeneous) variables $X_k$.
The strength and functional form of the relationships between the variables is defined by a function $f$ and its parameters $\Theta$.

The GAN was first proposed by \textcite{goodfellow2014generative} (later published as \textcite{goodfellow2020generative}).
