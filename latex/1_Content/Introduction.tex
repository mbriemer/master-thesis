\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This thesis is based on the paper \textcite{kaji2023adversarial} (KMP).
My presentation on notation largy follow that paper, \textcite{goodfellow2014generative} and, where they relate to the Wasserstein distance, \textcite{arjovsky2017wassersteingan}.
I was inspired to investigate the Wasserstein distance by \textcite{athey2021using}.
